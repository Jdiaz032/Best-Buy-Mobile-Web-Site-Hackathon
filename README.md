This project truely showed me that I am not ready for big data predictive analytics, and helped me in practicing big data cleaning. However,
I would have to say that the time needed to run the chunks led to many errors, and it was extremely frustrating to quickly learn. This is because
I live by the saying,"In order to double your success rate you need to double your failure rate." I was not able to fail quickly and therefore
my rate of success was limited. In the future I plan to improve upon my workflow to skip some of the constraints provided to me in this process. 
I need to discover those techniques, but knowing your problem is half the battle.
